![Logo](assets/logo_busi_1.jpg)


## 🌍 Empowering SHGs through Digital Innovation

Vyapar Saathi is an AI-powered multilingual Telegram chatbot ecosystem designed to help Self Help Group (SHG) businesses sell products digitally without needing apps, websites, or technical knowledge.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are complex, English-centric, and difficult to use for rural sellers with low digital literacy. Vyapar Saathi solves this by turning simple chat and voice into a complete marketplace experience.

This system allows SHG businesses to register, list products, promote items, and manage orders — all through Telegram in their native language.
